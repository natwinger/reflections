When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    -When there are several people working on the same project
    -If you want input from the public or someone who might know more
    -To back-up your work in case your local repository is "lost"
    -If you need to work on another computer, like a work computer and home computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	-If other people are working on the project, you want to pull the changes when you 
	know you will understand what they have done. So you don't get confused.
	-Same as before, you don't want random commits to come to your local repository 
	because they might not make sense or the author might change them further.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	-Forks make a copy of someone else's GitHub files to your GitHub account
	-Clones make a copy of files on GitHub (or on your local repository) to your (maybe different) local repository
	-Branches split the direction of your work, so that you can add different levels or
	versions of your code without changing the original. No copies are made, though.
	-Forks are used over clones when you are starting with someone else's work that you
	don't have permission to edit. You get your own copy to use
	-Branches are used to make different versions of code from a certain point, but not to make copies
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	-You can be fully up-to-date on other peoples' updates
	-You resolve conflicting changes before there are too many of them
